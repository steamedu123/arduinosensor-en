  ## [Our Goals]
  This book was written to help you and your family breathe easier and live healthier lives.
  Fine dust is taking away our right to clean air. However, with sensors and Arduino, we can measure the air quality both indoors and outdoors and find out how we can improve the air we breathe. This book will guide you through 18 environmental sensors used with Arduino.  Four projects can be used to measure the atmospheric environment.
  
  This book uses Arduino and air quality measurement sensors to measure the conditions of our surroundings. By the end of the book, you will be able to understand and use 18 Arduino environmental sensors. Chapter 2 covers the fine dust sensor, Chapter 3 indoor air environmental sensors, Chapter 4 outdoor air environmental sensors, and Chapter 5 covers how air environmental sensors can be calibrated to check air quality. Finally, Chapter 6 goes over four projects to measure the atmospheric environment. You will make simple fine dust and temperature-humidity sensors and find applications for them. In each project, you will be able to display air quality data on LCD, OLED screens and by connecting to Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or RD, create your own IoT in your house.  
  
  I hope that with this book, you will acquire the knowledge to use, prototype, and create various environmental sensors.
  
  ## [A good start is half the battle.]
  Anyone can handle Arduino and sensors in a fun and easy way!
  
  Prepare: Getting Started with Sensors and Arduino
  Choose the right sensor for your situation and learn the basic knowledge you need to know to handle it properly. Learn about the various characteristics that determine the performance of the sensor, the interface method, and precautions for use. Install the program to run Arduino and check how to use the library to be used for practice, and you are ready!
  
  Practice: Measuring the pollutants that harm your body
  From simple temperature and humidity to fine dust, ultraviolet rays, formaldehyde, and radiation, we will cover 18 sensors that can measure air pollutants and atmospheric conditions that affect the human body. We will explore the specifications, features, and operating principles of each sensor and connect them with Arduino to accurately measure the value.
  
  One more step!: Take on a sensor project
  If you have studied how each sensor works and measured the air environment around you, you can now apply the sensor to various projects. In this book, we will make a simple â€˜fine dust & temperature and humidity meter' and use LCD, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and RF communication to display the results of the project.
  
  ## [Expectations]
  Sensors are also seeing increased use in all aspects of our lives. They must be small, robust, durable. inexpensive, and have low power consumption.
  As IoT begin to dominate our interactions with one another (Hyper Connected Society), an estimated 100 billion objects will be connected and able to communicate through the Internet. Additionally, trillions of sensors will be installed, and the global sensor market is expected to reach a value of 220 trillion won. Smart tools are also being developed that can connect with IoT and make our lives more convenient. The Fourth Industrial Revolution all starts with robust sensors that can quickly and accurately measure data.
